#The following will show a sample size of 10 with a normal distribution. This includes multiple variables such as a logical vector, character vector, and factor vector.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
hw1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10),
  vec_char = c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd","ee","ff","gg","hh","ii","jj"),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric >0,
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female","female", "female","female", "female", "male", "female")))
```
#Checking the data frame
```{r}
hw1_df
```
# Checking to find the mean of the variables. Mean worked for the vec_logical and vec_numeric variables because they had numerical values.
```{r}
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_numeric))  
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_logical))
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```
# Converting one type of variable to the other. NAs were introduced as coercionfor the vec_char variable. The vec_factor variable was turned into 1s and 2s.
```{r}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
